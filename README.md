## cloud.gov PHP Example Application:  WordPress

This is an example application which can be run on cloud.gov using the CloudFoundry [PHP buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/php/index.html).

This is an out-of-the-box implementation of WordPress. It's an example of how common PHP applications can easily be run on cloud.gov

### Installation

1. Clone this repo.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/18F/cf-ex-wordpress.git cf-ex-wordpress
  cd cf-ex-wordpress
  ```
2. Create a service instance of a MySQL Database
 * View Services
    * `cf marketplace`
 * View Specific Service Plans
    * Template: `cf marketplace -s SERVICE`
    * Example: `cf marketplace -s aws-rds`
 * Create Service Instance
    * Template: `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE`
    * Example: `cf create-service aws-rds shared-mysql mysql-service`

3. Create a service instance of S3 storage.

cloud.gov does not have persistent local storage so you'll need to rely on S3 for storing any files uploaded to WordPress. Sandbox accounts cannot create S3 storage services. Consider upgrading to a prototyping package if you need to do this.

  * View Services
     * `cf marketplace`
  * View Specific Service Plans
     * Template: `cf marketplace -s SERVICE`
     * Example: `cf marketplace -s s3`
  * Create Service Instance
     * Template: `cf create-service SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE`
     * Example: `cf create-service s3 basic-public s3-service`

4. Copy the example `manifest.yml.example` to `manifest.yml`. Edit the `manifest.yml` file.
  * Change the 'name' and 'host' attributes to something unique for your site.
  * Under "services:" change
    * "mysql-service" to the name of your MySQL service you created in Step 2.
    * "s3-storage" to the name of your S3 service you created in Step 3. Or delete this line if you're not using S3.
  * The memory and disk allocations in the example `manifest.yml` file should be [sufficient for WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP) but may need to be adjusted depending on your specific needs.

5. Copy the example `setup.json.example` to `setup.json`. Edit the `setup.json` file for your specific WordPress site information, plugins you want installed, and themes.
  * **NOTE** The example includes a set of plugins that will be used to attach to your previously created S3 storage so you can store media uploads, like pictures, for your WordPress site. If you do not use these plugins, every time you deploy, uploaded files will be lost.
  * See: [Setup JSON](#setup-json) for more information about the format of this file

6. Deploy the app with a no start command with`cf push --no-start`

This will download and install WordPress, configure it to use your MySQL service, and install all your plugins and themes but will not start the application on cloud.gov.

7. Set environment variables for secret keys using [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/).

Make sure to include the leading and closing `'` characters to avoid errors escaping special characters.

  ```bash
  cf set-env mywordpress AUTH_KEY YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress SECURE_AUTH_KEY YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress LOGGED_IN_KEY YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress NONCE_KEY YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress AUTH_SALT YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress SECURE_AUTH_SALT YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress LOGGED_IN_SALT YOUR_KEY
  cf set-env mywordpress NONCE_SALT YOUR_KEY
  ```

8. Push it to CloudFoundry.

Run:

  ```bash
  cf push
  ```

This will push the files in this repository to the platform (around 25k), including the buildpack extension we've adapted from the Cloud Foundry project. The server downloads and runs the [PHP buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/php/index.html) which installs HTTPD and PHP. The buildpack sees the extension which installs [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), reads your `setup.json`, and installs and configures WordPress with any plugins or themes you have defined. Then it copies the `wp-config.php` file to replace the default from WordPress. Once all that is finished, the platform starts the application. Now you have a WordPress site.

You should see output like this in your terminal:

  ```
  App started


  OK

  App mywordpress was started using this command `$HOME/.bp/bin/start`

  Showing health and status for app mywordpress in org sandbox-gsa / space your.name as your.name@agency.gov...
  OK

  requested state: started
  instances: 1/1
  usage: 128M x 1 instances
  urls: my-special-wordpress.app.cloud.gov
  last uploaded: Tue Sep 26 22:21:49 UTC 2017
  stack: cflinuxfs2
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack
  ```

If you go to the URL listed under `urls` you should see a fresh WordPress site.


9. Verify S3 connection

This demo uses the [Human Made S3 Uploads plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/S3-Uploads), which automatically uploads files from your WordPress install to S3 and rewrites the URLs for you. The app requires no configuration. The access keys, secret key, and bucket name are stored in the environment configuration and read by the plugin on start.

```
cf run-task mywordpress "php/bin/php htdocs/wp-cli.phar s3-uploads verify --path='/home/vcap/app/htdocs/'"
```

To see that the task ran, run `cf logs APP_NAME --recent` and you should see a line that says

```
OUT Success: Looks like your configuration is correct.
```

10. Log in and test

To test everything is correct, log in to your WordPress site with the credentials in your `setup.json` file. You should be able to do any admin activities including creating a new post and uploading a media file to it.

### Administering your WordPress site

This example app uses `wp-cli` to install and configure WordPress based on the data in your `setup.json` file. If you want to further customize your installation you can edit the `.extensions/wordpress/extension.py` file in this repo or use continuous integration to run more `wp-cli` commands after the basic installer runs.

#### Basic site options

The `site_info` section of the `setup.json` file is required and supplies basic information the Cloud Foundry process needs to set up your WordPress site. It looks like this by default:

```json
{
  "site_info": {
    "url": "https://mysite.app.cloud.gov",
    "title": "My new site",
    "admin_user": "admin",
    "admin_password": "CHANGEME",
    "admin_email": "my.email@example.com"
  }
}
```

Make sure you change these values, especially `url` and `title` to something specific to your app. At this time, these are the only options managed by the build process.

#### Updating WordPress

By default, this package will install the latest version of WordPress. To update WordPress or pick up a new version of the PHP builpack, [run `cf restage APP_NAME`](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/). cloud.gov will install a fresh copy of WordPress Core each time you `push` or `restage`. We **do not recommend** using the wp-admin interface to manage updates to your site.

If you want to pin your Core installation to a specific version of WordPress, add `"wordpress_version": VERSION_NUMBER` on a line above the `site_info` section.

```json
{
  "wordpress_version": "4.8.2",
  "site_info": {
  }
}
```

**Note: We recommend running the latest stable version of WordPress on production sites.** The latest version typically contains important security updates. If you pin the WordPress version, you will need to manually increment this value to upgrade your install. Make sure you follow [the update schedule on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/) to keep up with important security and maintenance releases.

#### Themes and plugins

The Cloud Foundry platform builds apps with ephemeral local storage. This means any changes made to local files on your app will get deleted whenever you `push` or `restage` the app. Make sure your plugins and themes remain installed by installing them through the `plugins` and `themes` sections of the `setup.json` file.

For plugins or themes you'd normally be able to install from the admin interface, you can list them by name and the version that you want installed. For anything not available through WordPress directly, provide a URL to a ZIP file. For example, if your site's theme is one you've custom-developed, you can host it on GitHub and use the "Download ZIP" link to install it.

```json
"plugins": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/humanmade/S3-Uploads/archive/v1.1.0.zip"
    },
    {
      "name": "akismet",
      "version": "4.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "hello-dolly"
    }
],
"themes": [
    {
        "name": "create",
        "version": "1.3"
    }
  ]
```

In the sample `setup.json` file you see three plugins installed by default. One from GitHub and two from WordPress, one of which is pinned to a specific version. As with WordPress Core, if you pin the version, make sure to watch for and install updates that contain security fixes.

#### Running WP-CLI commands

We recommend using Cloud Foundry's "tasks" to run `wp-cli` commands. To do this, make sure to give the full path for both PHP and the `wp-cli.phar` file and specify the WordPress path relative to the `app` directory. Here's how you'd run `wp core version` on your cloud.gov container:

```bash
cf run-task APP_NAME "php/bin/php htdocs/wp-cli.phar core version --path='htdocs/'"
```

That should print something like:

```
Creating task for app APP_NAME in org ORG_NAME / space SPACE_NAME as USER_NAME...
OK

Task has been submitted successfully for execution.
task name:   98680974
task id:     30
```

Run `cf logs APP_NAME --recent` to see the results and look for the `task name` to see the results. The task will create a container, run your command and then destroy the container after the task exits.

```
2017-09-27T10:54:44.36-0600 [APP/TASK/98680974/0] OUT Creating container
2017-09-27T10:54:44.81-0600 [APP/TASK/98680974/0] OUT Successfully created container

2017-09-27T10:54:51.52-0600 [APP/TASK/98680974/0] OUT Destroying container
2017-09-27T10:54:52.92-0600 [APP/TASK/98680974/0] OUT Successfully destroyed container
```

Consider using [continuous integration](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/continuous-deployment/) to run any tasks that should be run every time you `push` or `restage` your app or that you want to run at regular time intervals.


### Full example setup.json file
```json
{
  "wordpress_version": "4.4",
  "site_info": {
    "url": "https://CHANGEME.app.cloud.gov",
    "title": "My new site",
    "admin_user": "admin",
    "admin_password": "CHANGEME",
    "admin_email": "my.email@example.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "akismet",
      "version": "4.0"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.org/my-great-plugin-0.1.zip"
    }
  ],
  "themes": [
    {
      "name": "create",
      "version": "1.3"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Recommendations

1. You will probably want to connect your app to some kind of SMTP service to send transactional emails like password resets.
1. The S3 Uploads plugin rewrites the URLs used by WordPress but does not flush the rewrite rules table automatically. To get around this, you can [run a task](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/one-off-tasks/) to flush the rewrite rules after every `cf push` of your app. You can also automate those tasks by using [continuous integration](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/continuous-deployment/).
